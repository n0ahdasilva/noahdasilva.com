          imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
          settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we
          may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that
          tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt
          out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing

          If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would

        list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to
        make public on such a social media platform.

        We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are

        their sites and apps.

        be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and

        we may share your personal information (see 'WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE

        If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United

        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will

      </p>
      <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
        personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such
        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.

        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and

        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals,
        or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within

      <p><u>Verification process</u></p>
      <p>
        Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
        determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in
        our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
        information so that we can match it with information you have previously
        provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit,
        we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the
        information you provide with the information we already have on file, or
        we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email)
        that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
        verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify
        your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible,
        we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
        purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity
        from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you
        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
        identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
        such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying
        you.
